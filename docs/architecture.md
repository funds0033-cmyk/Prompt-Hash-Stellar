# PromptHash Stellar Architecture

## System Components

PromptHash Stellar is organized into three main layers.

## 1. Soroban Contract Layer

Path: `contracts/prompt-hash`

Responsibilities:

- store prompt listing records
- track creator-owned listings
- track buyer purchase rights
- route XLM payments and platform fees
- expose read methods for marketplace views

Core contract methods:

- `create_prompt`
- `buy_prompt`
- `has_access`
- `get_prompt`
- `get_all_prompts`
- `get_prompts_by_creator`
- `get_prompts_by_buyer`
- `update_prompt_price`
- `set_prompt_sale_status`
- `set_fee_percentage` — canonical fee-configuration entrypoint, bounded to `MAX_PLATFORM_FEE` (1,000 bps / 10%). `update_platform_fee` is a deprecated alias that delegates to the same bounded internal path, so neither entrypoint can be used to bypass the other's ceiling.
- `set_fee_wallet`

## 2. Frontend Application Layer

Path: `src`

Responsibilities:

- wallet connection and transaction signing
- client-side encryption before contract submission
- marketplace browsing and filtering
- creator listing management
- buyer unlock initiation

Important modules:

- `src/pages/sell/CreatePromptForm.tsx`
- `src/pages/browse/PromptModal.tsx`
- `src/pages/sell/MyPrompts.tsx`
- `src/lib/stellar/promptHashClient.ts`
- `src/lib/crypto/promptCrypto.ts`

## 3. Unlock / Auth Layer

Paths:

- `api/auth/challenge.ts`
- `api/prompts/unlock.ts`

Responsibilities:

- mint challenge tokens
- verify wallet signature on unlock requests
- read contract access state
- unwrap the encrypted AES key
- decrypt the prompt payload
- validate content integrity by hash

## Data Flow

### Create listing

1. User enters title, preview, category, image URL, price, and full prompt text.
2. Browser encrypts prompt plaintext with AES-GCM.
3. Browser wraps the AES key using the unlock service public key.
4. App submits the encrypted payload and metadata to Soroban.

### Buy listing

1. Buyer approves native asset spend.
2. App submits `buy_prompt`.
3. Contract holds the payment in a dispute-protected escrow and records purchase rights.
4. After settlement, the contract distributes the snapshotted payout shares.

### Revenue-share rounding

Prompt, bundle, and access-pass purchases use basis-point shares totaling
10,000, including the creator's residual share. Settlement floors each share
to whole stroops and carries its fractional numerator forward per asset,
recipient, and share role. Collaborator carries are isolated by prompt ID.
When a carry reaches a whole stroop, that stroop is paid to the recipient.

The undistributed integer balance stays in the contract as a rounding reserve
and is included in per-asset solvency liabilities. Carry state is updated only
when an escrow settles; pending and refunded escrows do not affect it. This
keeps disputes/refunds isolated from completed settlement history. Legacy
escrows without a rounding snapshot continue using their stored payout plan.

Maintainers can inspect `get_revenue_rounding_report(asset)`, which reports the
cumulative newly accrued fractional numerator and the currently backed reserve
in stroops. The shared arithmetic module is tested with 2,048 uneven shares
over 500 rounds; those scale simulations complement the contract settlement
and refund tests.

Per-recipient carry is persistent contract state with the normal Soroban
persistent-entry TTL. Reading
`get_revenue_rounding_remainder(asset, recipient, kind, source_id)` refreshes
that entry; use `source_id = 0` for fee, referral, and creator shares, and the
prompt ID for collaborator shares. Maintainers should refresh dormant carries
before their TTL expires so fractional entitlements are not lost to storage
expiry.

### Unlock purchased prompt

1. Buyer requests a challenge token for a specific prompt.
2. Wallet signs the challenge message.
3. Unlock endpoint verifies token, signature, and `has_access`.
4. Service decrypts prompt plaintext and returns it to the buyer.

### Hand off a listing (ownership transfer)

The Soroban `Prompt.creator` is immutable, so re-pointing who operates a
listing is a two-phase, wallet-signature-gated OFF-chain handoff coordinated
by the central server (routes under `/api/prompts/transfers/*`, see
`server/src/routes/promptRoutes.ts`):

1. The current indexed owner requests a transfer to a recipient wallet.
2. The recipient wallet signs an approval (or rejection).
3. On approval the server re-points the indexed `Prompt.owner` to the
   recipient's `User` record and records a `rejectionReason` if the handoff
   later fails.
4. Requests expire after 72 hours and stay in a `pending`/`expired` state
   until the recipient responds or the requester cancels.

`Prompt.creator` (and therefore where license fees ultimately settle) is never
changed.

## Security Model

The current design intentionally separates concerns:

- Soroban stores encrypted prompt content and access state
- the browser performs initial prompt encryption
- the server only releases plaintext after both wallet proof and contract proof succeed

Important assumptions:

- the unlock service private key must remain secret
- the challenge secret must be rotated and stored securely
- contract IDs and network settings must be configured correctly per environment

## Scalability Notes

The current frontend reads marketplace data directly from contract methods. This is acceptable for early-stage demos and review environments, but a production deployment will likely need:

- indexing and caching
- pagination
- search infrastructure
- moderation and abuse handling

## Deployment Shape

The current repository supports a lightweight deployment model:

- frontend + serverless unlock endpoints on Vercel
- contract deployed to Stellar testnet or future mainnet target
- optional auxiliary Express server for external chat/proxy services
