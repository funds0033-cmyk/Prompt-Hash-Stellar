## What is PromptHash Stellar?

PromptHash Stellar is a blockchain-powered marketplace for selling reusable AI prompts. Unlike traditional platforms, PromptHash gives you:

- **Full Control:** Your prompts are encrypted end-to-end; only buyers with verified wallet access can unlock them
- **Transparent Payments:** XLM transfers settle on-chain with zero intermediaries taking cuts
- **Repeat Revenue:** Each buyer gets permanent access; you can resell the same prompt infinitely
- **No Intermediary Risk:** Your earnings are controlled by smart contracts, not corporate policies

**In Plain English:**
- You write a prompt → You encrypt it → You set a price in XLM → Buyers pay → They get lifetime access

## Why Licensing, Not NFTs?

You might wonder: "Why not use NFTs?"

**The key difference:**

| Aspect | NFTs | PromptHash Licensing |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| **What buyer owns** | A unique token (collectible) | Permanent access rights |
| **Can creator resell?** | No (buyer owns it now) | Yes, infinite sales to different buyers |
| **Revenue model** | One-time sale per NFT | Recurring royalties per sale |
| **Buyer value** | Ownership/bragging rights | Actual usable content |
| **Best for** | Art, collectibles, uniqueness | Prompts, templates, knowledge products |

**Why PromptHash Uses Licensing:**
- You want to sell the same prompt to 100 people, not just one
- Buyers don't care about "owning" a prompt; they care about using it
- Licensing supports creator economy better than NFTs for knowledge products
- Transparent, simple revenue sharing on-chain

## Step 1: Set Up Your Freighter Wallet

### What is Freighter?

Freighter is a browser wallet extension that securely manages your Stellar account and XLM funds. It's like a digital bank account for cryptocurrency.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Go to Freighter Website:**
   - Visit https://www.freighter.app/
   - Click "Install Freighter" or go to your browser's extension store:
     - **Chrome:** Chrome Web Store, search "Freighter"
     - **Firefox:** Firefox Add-ons, search "Freighter"
     - **Brave:** Built-in extension store, search "Freighter"

2. **Install the Extension:**
   - Click "Add to Chrome" / "Add to Firefox" / etc.
   - Confirm the permission popup
   - Freighter icon should appear in your browser's top-right corner

3. **Create or Import Wallet:**

   **Option A: Create New Wallet**
   - Click Freighter icon
   - Click "Create Account"
   - Choose a strong password (minimum 12 characters, mix of uppercase, numbers, special characters)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Freighter will show your "Recovery Phrase" (12-24 words)
     - **SAVE THIS PHRASE** in a secure location (not on your computer!)
     - Do NOT share this phrase with anyone
     - You'll need it to restore your wallet
   - Click "I Saved My Recovery Phrase"
   - Confirm by re-entering some words
   - Done! Your wallet is created

   **Option B: Restore Existing Wallet**
   - Click Freighter icon
   - Click "Restore Account"
   - Enter your 12 or 24-word recovery phrase
   - Create a strong password
   - Done!

4. **Verify Your Account:**
   - Open Freighter
   - You should see:
     - Your wallet address (starts with `G`)
     - Your XLM balance (currently 0)
     - Network selector (ensure you're on correct network)

### Security Best Practices

- **Never share your recovery phrase** - anyone with it has access to all your funds
- **Use a strong, unique password** - different from all your other passwords
- **Test wallet recovery** - verify your recovery phrase works before relying on it
- **Keep your recovery phrase offline** - write it down or store in a password manager
- **Use browser protection** - ensure your computer has antivirus/security software

## Step 2.5: Complete Payout Readiness Validation

**NEW REQUIREMENT:** Before you can publish paid prompts, PromptHash validates that your payout setup is complete. This prevents failed settlements and ensures you can receive earnings from buyers.

### What is Payout Readiness?

Payout readiness is a 4-step validation system that checks:

1. **Wallet Connection** ✅ Valid Stellar address connected
2. **Payout Destination** ✅ Configured address where earnings will be sent  
3. **Creator Profile** ✅ Complete profile with display name and bio
4. **Settlement Readiness** ✅ Sufficient XLM balance for transaction fees

### Checking Your Payout Readiness

1. **Go to the Create Prompt page** - You'll see a payout readiness banner at the top
2. **Check your status** - The banner shows whether you're ready or what needs to be completed
3. **Click "Fix Setup"** if you see blocking issues
4. **Or visit the detailed checklist** at `/sell/payout-readiness` for step-by-step guidance

### Completing Each Requirement

#### 1. Wallet Connection
- This is automatic once you connect your Freighter wallet
- Your wallet address must be a valid Stellar format (starts with 'G')

#### 2. Payout Destination  
- Go to **Profile → Payout Settings**
- Enter a valid Stellar destination address where you want earnings sent:
  - **Standard Wallets:** Standard Stellar public key starting with `G...` (e.g. self-custody Freighter, Lobstr, Albedo).
  - **Exchange Accounts (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.):** If sending to a custodial exchange that requires a memo (SEP-0029), you **MUST** provide a **Muxed Account address starting with `M...` (SEP-0023)**. Smart contract marketplace settlements cannot attach manual transaction memo text, so using a standard `G...` exchange address without a muxed ID will result in trapped or lost funds.
  - **Prohibited:** Secret keys (`S...`), Soroban Contract IDs (`C...`), and signed payloads (`P...`) are strictly rejected.
- You can use the same address as your connected wallet, or a dedicated payout address.
- **On-Chain Verification:** Payout settings automatically verify with the Stellar Horizon network to ensure the destination account is funded and compatible before saving.

#### 3. Creator Profile
- Go to **Profile → Settings**  
- Fill in **required fields:**
  - Display Name (up to 50 characters)
  - Bio (up to 280 characters)
- Fill in **recommended fields** for better buyer trust:
  - Profile picture URL
  - Website or social media links

#### 4. Settlement Readiness
- Ensure you have at least **2 XLM** in your connected wallet
- This covers transaction fees for publishing prompts
- **Testnet:** Get free XLM from the [Stellar testnet faucet](https://stellar.org/developers/reference/testnet)
- **Mainnet:** Buy XLM from exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, or Uphold

### What Happens When You're Not Ready?

- **Prompt publication is blocked** - You can't submit the create prompt form
- **Clear error messages** - You'll see exactly what needs to be completed
- **Direct action links** - Click buttons to go straight to the right settings page
- **Draft saving still works** - Your prompt drafts are saved while you complete setup

### What Happens When You're Ready?

- **Green checkmarks everywhere** ✅
- **"Ready to publish paid prompts!"** status message
- **Normal prompt creation** - All features work as expected
- **Immediate earnings** - Buyers' payments come directly to your payout address

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"Invalid payout address format or checksum"**
- Make sure your address starts with `G` (56 characters) or `M` (69 characters for Muxed accounts).
- Copy-paste directly from your wallet or exchange to prevent typos.
- Never enter a secret key (starts with `S`).

**"Destination account requires a memo (SEP-0029)"**
- Centralized exchanges use shared receiving addresses that require a memo.
- Provide your exchange's **Muxed Address (starts with `M`)** which embeds the memo ID into the address itself.
- Alternatively, use a personal self-custody wallet (Freighter) as your payout destination.

**"Destination account is not funded on Stellar"**
- Stellar accounts must be activated with minimum reserve XLM on the network before they can receive smart contract payouts.
- Fund the account with at least 1-2 XLM on the active network (Testnet or Mainnet).

**"Insufficient XLM balance"**  
- You need at least 2 XLM in your connected wallet for transaction fees.
- Balance is checked in real-time.
- Add more XLM and the check will automatically update.

**"Complete your creator profile"**
- Display name and bio are required for paid prompts.
- This builds buyer trust and reduces disputes.
- Optional fields (avatar, links) improve your profile but aren't required.

**"Unable to verify payout readiness"**
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache if the issue persists

### Getting Help

1. **Check the detailed checklist** - Visit `/sell/payout-readiness` for interactive guidance
2. **Review this documentation** - All steps are covered above
3. **Ask the community** - Join our Discord/GitHub discussions
4. **Contact support** - Email us if you find a technical issue

## Step 3: Fund Your Wallet with XLM

You need XLM (Stellar Lumens) to list and eventually transfer funds from sales. Here's how to get it.

### For Testing (Testnet)

If you're testing PromptHash on testnet:

1. Go to [Stellar Development Foundation Testnet Faucet](https://stellar.org/developers/reference/testnet)
2. Enter your wallet address (from Freighter)
3. Click "Get Started with Test Network"
4. You'll instantly receive test XLM

**Note:** Test XLM has no real value; it's only for development/testing.

### For Real Use (Mainnet)

You need to buy real XLM from an exchange:

**Beginner-Friendly Options:**
1. **Coinbase**
   - Visit https://coinbase.com
   - Create account, verify identity
   - Buy XLM using credit card or bank transfer
   - Withdraw XLM to your Freighter wallet address

2. **Kraken**
   - Visit https://kraken.com
   - Create account, verify identity
   - Trade USD/EUR for XLM
   - Withdraw XLM to your Freighter wallet address

3. **Uphold**
   - Visit https://uphold.com
   - Fast, minimal KYC
   - Buy XLM directly
   - Withdraw to Freighter

**Cost Estimate:**
- Start with 5-10 XLM ($0.50-$1.00 depending on price)
- Covers: listing costs + transaction fees + testing

**Withdrawal Steps:**
1. Copy your Freighter wallet address
2. In exchange: Go to "Withdraw" or "Send"
3. Paste your wallet address
4. Enter amount (e.g., 5 XLM)
5. Confirm
6. Wait 5-15 minutes for deposit to Freighter

### Checking Your Balance

- Open Freighter extension
- Click on your account
- You should see your XLM balance
- Green checkmark means funds are confirmed

## Best Practices for Previews

Your preview is crucial—it decides if a buyer purchases or scrolls past.

### The Psychology of Conversions

**What buyers are thinking:**
- "Is this prompt actually useful for me?"
- "Will it save me time/money?"
- "Can I use it right away?"
- "Is the price fair?"

**Your preview must answer all of these in 2-3 sentences.**

### Preview Formula

```
[Direct Benefit] + [Specific Use Case] + [Result]
```

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad Preview:**
> "ChatGPT prompt for writing"

✅ **Good Preview:**
> "Use this prompt to generate high-converting product descriptions for Shopify in seconds. Include your product details, and get 3 optimized descriptions ready to paste into your store. Saves hours on copywriting."

---

❌ **Bad Preview:**
> "Coding helper prompt"

✅ **Good Preview:**
> "Generate clean, production-ready Python functions with full docstrings and error handling. Paste your requirements, get working code with tests. Perfect for speeding up backend development."

---

### Preview Checklist

- [ ] Starts with the main benefit (not the tool name)
- [ ] Includes specific use case (not generic)
- [ ] Mentions the output the buyer gets
- [ ] Shows time/effort savings
- [ ] Includes action verbs (Generate, Create, Write, Automate, etc.)
- [ ] Is honest (don't oversell)
- [ ] Fits in 2-3 sentences

### Naming Best Practices

**Good Titles:**
- "LinkedIn Post Generator - Viral Engagement Formula"
- "Code Review Prompt - Find Performance Bugs Fast"
- "Email Subject Line Optimizer - Proven Open Rate Boost"

**Weak Titles:**
- "ChatGPT Prompt" (too generic)
- "Helper" (unclear)
- "Cool Tool" (no benefit)

---

## Pricing Your Prompts

### Pricing Framework

**Consider these factors:**

1. **Time Saved for Buyer**
   - If it saves 1 hour of work, price high ($1-5 XLM)
   - If it saves 10 minutes, price low ($0.10-0.50 XLM)
   - Formula: Hourly rate × hours saved / 10

2. **Market Competition**
   - Research similar prompts in your category
   - You can undercut slightly to gain initial reviews
   - Or charge premium if yours is clearly better

3. **Perceived Value**
   - High-value use cases (revenue-generating): $1-10 XLM+
   - Productivity helpers (time-saving): $0.50-2 XLM
   - Learning/hobby prompts: $0.10-0.50 XLM

4. **Your Experience Level**
   - Beginner: Start low ($0.25-0.50 XLM) to build reputation
   - Intermediate: $0.50-2 XLM
   - Expert: $2-10+ XLM (especially if niche)

### Pricing Examples

| Prompt Type | Use Case | Suggested Price |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| Blog outline generator | Saves 30 mins per article | 0.50-1 XLM |
| Code snippet complete | Saves 1-2 hours | 1-2 XLM |
| Sales email template | Proven high conversion | 2-5 XLM |
| Learning guide starter | Educational | 0.10-0.25 XLM |
| Custom workflow | Specific niche + proven ROI | 5-20 XLM |

### Dynamic Pricing Strategy

**Month 1:** Start at lower price to gain reviews
- Example: 0.50 XLM for a prompt you'd eventually price at 2 XLM
- Why: Reviews build trust; first 5-10 sales are crucial

**After 10 Sales:** Raise price gradually
- Increase by 0.25-0.50 XLM every 10 sales
- Monitor if sales slow down (sign that price is too high)
- Adjust accordingly

**Track Your Data:**
- How many views per day?
- Conversion rate (views → purchases)?
- Are sales slowing down? Price might be too high.

## Marketing and Discovery

Your listing is live, but how do buyers find it?

### Built-In Discovery

1. **Search:** Buyers can search by category, keywords
2. **Featured Prompts:** Top-performing prompts get featured
3. **Creator Profile:** Link to your profile shows all your prompts
4. **Reviews:** Higher rated prompts rank higher

2. **Ask for Feedback, Not Sales**
   - "Check out my prompt, would love feedback!"
   - Non-pushy, people are more likely to engage
   - Some will buy out of curiosity

3. **Offer Early-Bird Pricing**
   - Price a prompt low for the first week
   - Then increase it
   - Mention: "Early adopters only"

4. **Create a Bundle**
   - If you list multiple prompts, mention them as a collection
   - "3 prompts for X usecase, buy all to maximize value"

5. **Update Your Prompts Regularly**

## FAQ for Creators

### Q: What is payout readiness validation?

**A:** Payout readiness validation is a new requirement that ensures creators can receive earnings before they publish paid prompts. It checks:
- Wallet connection is valid
- Payout destination is configured  
- Creator profile is complete (display name and bio required)
- Sufficient XLM balance for transaction fees

This prevents failed settlements and support issues.

### Q: Why can't I publish my prompt?

**A:** If you see "Complete payout setup to publish" on the submit button, you need to:
1. Check the payout readiness banner for specific issues
2. Visit Profile → Settings to complete your profile
3. Visit Profile → Payout Settings to configure your payout address
4. Ensure you have at least 2 XLM in your wallet
5. All checks must show green ✅ before you can publish

### Q: Can I save drafts while completing payout setup?

**A:** Yes! Draft auto-saving works normally while you complete payout readiness. Your prompt content is preserved while you fix any blocking issues.

### Q: How do I get paid?

**A:** XLM from sales automatically goes to your configured payout address (set in Profile → Payout Settings). You can:
- Keep it in your wallet (hold for value appreciation)
- Withdraw to an exchange and convert to USD/fiat
- Spend it directly (some places accept XLM)

**New:** Payout addresses are validated during setup to ensure payments reach you successfully.

### Q: What if I want to update my prompt?

**A:** You can edit:
- Title
- Preview text
- Price
- Featured image

You **cannot** change the full encrypted prompt (for buyer security). If you need major changes, create a new listing.

### Q: How do I handle a disputed sale or refund request?

**A:** Per the platform terms:
- Sales are typically final (blockchain immutability)
- For genuine errors, contact platform support
- They may mediate or escalate

### Q: Can I sell the same prompt on other platforms?

**A:** Yes! You can:
- Sell on PromptHash AND other marketplaces
- There are no exclusivity requirements
- Multi-channel approach maximizes your revenue

### Q: How much does PromptHash take as a cut?

**A:** Check the current platform fees in the docs. Typically:
- Creator gets: 95% of sale price
- Platform takes: 5% (to cover infrastructure)
- All transactions are visible on-chain

### Q: What if my prompt isn't selling?

**Troubleshooting checklist:**
1. **Check payout readiness** - Incomplete setup can affect buyer confidence
2. Improve your preview (see [Best Practices](#best-practices-for-previews))
3. Lower your price (test market demand)
4. Add better category/tags
5. Promote on social media
6. Check if prompt is working as described
7. **Ensure your profile looks professional** - Display name, bio, and avatar matter

### Q: Can I hire someone to write prompts for me?

**A:** Yes, but:
- You take responsibility for quality
- Ensure the creator/freelancer is credited in the preview
- Be transparent about authorship
- Respect intellectual property rights

### Q: What file formats for images?

**A:** Use PNG or JPG, ideally:
- 500x500px or larger
- Under 5MB
- Clear, professional-looking
- Represents your prompt well

### Q: How do I handle competitors copying my prompts?

**A:** They cannot because:
- Your prompt is encrypted end-to-end
- Only buyers with wallet verification access it
- Code/content theft is nearly impossible

What they *might* do:
- Copy your preview/title
- Create similar prompts

For identical copying: Report to platform moderators.

### Q: Can I sell editing/writing services alongside prompts?

**A:** Check platform guidelines. PromptHash focuses on:
- Selling prompts (primary)
- Individual services outside platform (your choice)

Avoid directly selling services through PromptHash if not intended.

### Q: What if I want to stop selling?

**A:** You can:
1. Deactivate prompts temporarily (hide from marketplace)
2. Delete prompts permanently
3. Your sales history remains on-chain (for transparency)
4. You can re-list anytime
